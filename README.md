# Test-Technique-Data-Scientist
This is a technical test proposed by AXA - Direct Assurance. The goal is to train a machine learning model and apply evaluation metrics to assess both the model and the data. The objective is to draw conclusions about the applied models, the available dataset, and the considered variables.

For this task, I chose to utilize linear regression and random forest models. To evaluate the performance of these models, I used two metrics: RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and R^2 (Coefficient of Determination).

In terms of data and variables, I employed KL (Kullback-Leibler) and JS (Jensen-Shannon) divergences to assess categorical variables, while for quantitative variables, I used Wasserstein distance.
